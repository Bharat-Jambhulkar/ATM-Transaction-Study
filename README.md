# ATM-Transaction-Study
The generated data is aggregated to represent ATM customer withdrawal arrivals per hour. An attempt is being made to generate transaction-level data, for which a Poisson process would be useful.
Update: The A2.R file contains code to generate transactions using a Poisson process for customer arrivals, with transaction amounts generated from a lognormal distribution.
